# scenario-pack
A mod for containing Factorio scenarios that I work on in my spare time


## Scenarios

# evo-combat
This is a scenario that is 100% combat related. Building of factories is not allowed. Instead, progress through the tech tree by causing the biters to evolve. To make the evolution go faster, you just need to destroy biter nests.

Stay out of combat for 30 seconds to have your ammunition resupplied. If you have advanced to the next tech level, you also need to stay out of combat for 30 seconds to recieve the new equipment.

# remote-viewing
A character-free scenario. You can move freely around and reach a long way, but your view is restricted to an area around the "AI Core". Build radars to discover new AI Cores, and transfer to them to expand your factory.
